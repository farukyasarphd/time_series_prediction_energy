# Time Series Prediction ofÂ Appliances Energy Consumption

In this project I build a machine learning model to predict energy consumption using a multivariate time series dataset. The main goal is to develop a robust model that can forecast energy usage for future periods where regressors (sensor data) is not available.

## Dataset

**Dataset Name**: Appliances Energy Prediction Dataset\
**Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository\
**Description**:

- The dataset contains measurements of energy consumption in a household collected over time.
- It includes temperature and humidity conditions recorded at various locations within the house.
- The target variable is the total energy consumed by appliances.

**Key Features**:

- `Appliances`: Energy consumption (target variable).
- Environmental conditions: Temperature, humidity, pressure.
- Time-based features: Date and time.

## Running Scripts and Notebooks

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the `notebooks/` folder and run the exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook.
3. Train and evaluate models using scripts inside the `src/` and `models/` folders.
